Async Flow

When a subreddit is selected (that is, when the machine is in the 'selected' state due to a 'SELECT' event), the machine should start loading the subreddit data. To do this, we invoke a Promise that will resolve with the selected subreddit data:

function invokeFetchSubreddit(context) {
  const { subreddit } = context;

  return fetch(`https://www.reddit.com/r/${subreddit}.json`)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(json => json.data.children.map(child => child.data));
}

const redditMachine = Machine({
  /* ... */
  states: {
    idle: {},
    selected: {
      invoke: {
        id: 'fetch-subreddit',
        src: invokeFetchSubreddit
      }
    }
  },
  on: {
    /* ... */
  }
});


//
Specifying an id on the invoke config object allows clearer debugging and visualization, as well as the ability to send events directly to an invoked entity by its id.

//
When the 'selected' state is entered, invokeFetchSubreddit(...) will be called with the current context and event (not used here) 
    and start fetching subreddit data from the Reddit API. 
    
    The promise can then take two special transitions:
        onDone - taken when the invoked promise resolves
        onError - taken when the invoked promise rejects


We can make 3 child states that represent when the subreddit is 
    'loading', 'loaded' or 'failed'
