create an app that displays a selected subreddit's posts. The app should be able to:
    Have a predefined list of subreddits that the user can select from
    Load the selected subreddit
    Display the last time the selected subreddit was loaded
    Reload the selected subreddit
    Select a different subreddit at any time

The app logic and state can be modeled with a single app-level machine, as well as invoked child machines for modeling the logic of each individual subreddit. 


// 1 start with a single machine.

Modeling the Reddit App
two top-level states:
    'idle' - no subreddit selected yet (the initial state)
    'selected' - a subreddit is selected

store initial subreddit state - context

    const redditMachine = Machine({
        id: 'reddit',
        initial: 'idle',
        context: {
            subreddit: null // none selected
        },
        states: {
            idle: {},
            selected: {}
        }
    });

event  transition for a 'SELECT' event, which signals that a subreddit was selected by the user. 

    const selectEvent = {
        type: 'SELECT', // event type
        name: 'reactjs' // subreddit name
    };


whenever the 'SELECT' event occurs, the machine will:
    transition to its child '.selected' state (notice the dot, which indicates a relative target)
    assign event.name to the context.subreddit


    on: {
        SELECT: {
            target: '.selected',
            actions: assign({
                subreddit: (context, event) => event.name
            })
        }
    }
