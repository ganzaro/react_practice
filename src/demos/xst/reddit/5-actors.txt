Using Actors

The machines we've created work, and fit our basic use-cases. However, suppose we want to support the following use-cases:
    When a subreddit is selected, it should load fully, even if a different one is selected (basic "caching")
    The user should see when a subreddit was last updated, and have the ability to refresh the subreddit.

A good mental model for this is the Actor model, 
    where each individual subreddit is its own "actor" that controls its own logic based on events, whether internal or external

an actor is an entity that has its own logic/behavior, 
    and it can receive and send events to other actors.
